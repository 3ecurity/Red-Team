I don't know what I was doing with this was trying to learn python for hacking, but then got bored. Will probably hop back
on at it again at a later time, to create more tools. Or personalized custom payloads that can help me Bypass AV. One of these
day's it will be easier for me to create compiled binaries for Windows Post-Exploitation.
